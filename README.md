# Memory Game Project

## How The Game Works
The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

### Functionalities to be implemented / Use Case

The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

### Additional functionalties
1. Simulate actual flipping of cards
2. Card color changes and other effects when 2 cards match 
3. Visual effects when cards do not match
4. Indicator when game is finished
5. Star scoring
